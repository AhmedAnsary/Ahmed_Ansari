Ansible Playbook and Jenkins Pipeline Configuration

Ansible Playbook: WebServerSetup.yml

Description:
The Ansible playbook WebServerSetup.yml automates the installation and configuration of the Apache HTTP Server on the target server. It ensures consistent and reproducible deployment of web server configurations across multiple environments.

Usage:
Ensure Ansible is installed on the control node.
Update the inventory file (hosts) with the target server's IP address or hostname.
Customize the playbook variables in WebServerSetup.yml as needed.
Run the playbook using the following command:

                                  ansible-playbook -i hosts WebServerSetup.yml

Playbook Structure:

Roles:
common: Tasks for common configurations.
webserver: Tasks for installing and configuring Apache HTTP Server.
Variables:
httpd_port: Port for Apache HTTP Server.

Other customizable variables for server configuration.
Dependencies
Ansible: Ensure Ansible is installed on the control node.
Target Server: Ensure the target server is reachable and has SSH access configured.


Jenkins Pipeline Configuration:

Description:
The Jenkins pipeline automates the CI/CD process for deploying applications, including building, testing, and deploying code changes. It integrates GitLab with Jenkins to trigger pipeline execution upon code commits.

Usage:
Install and configure Jenkins on the Jenkins server.
Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
Configure the pipeline job to use the Jenkinsfile located in the repository.
Ensure Jenkins has appropriate permissions and credentials to access the GitLab repository.
Run the pipeline manually or configure it to trigger automatically upon code changes in GitLab.

Pipeline Structure:
Stages:
Checkout: Clone the Git repository from GitLab.
Build: Build the application code.
Test: Run automated tests on the code.
Deploy: Deploy the application to the target environment.
Post-build Actions: Send notifications, generate reports, or perform cleanup tasks.

Dependencies:
Jenkins: Install and configure Jenkins on the Jenkins server.
GitLab: Ensure the GitLab repository is accessible and configured with webhooks or triggers to notify Jenkins of code changes.
Pipeline Plugins: Install Jenkins plugins for Git integration, pipeline execution, and other required functionalities.
